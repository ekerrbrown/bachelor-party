                A favorite pasttime of mine, D&B’s is the ultimate stop to
                having fun. This particular D&B’s has bowling, which will be the
                primary activity, but expect to charge up your gamercard and win
                some tickets.

                We are axe throwing until I can throw it like Jason Mamoa did

              <h4>Sports Betting</h4>
              <p>
                While I do not expect you to empty your bank account on it, I do
                ask that you sports bet at least one game a day with me while
                we’re there (minus my brother, who can’t because of work.)
                Ideally, we cook up something together and watch it cash at a
                bar. You can do as little as $1 per day on a bet. I found that
                rooting on bets you placed together is a top-5 experience in
                life and increases your investment in the games.

              runs thicker than the battle of blues. He’s an awesome personality
              who I know will bring the fun to the dance floor and make sure
              everything goes as smoothly as possible. Fun Acts About Immmanuel:

                Whether your mindset is “This is woke P.C. created by the libs”
                or “I need a safe space”, we can all agree that this weekend is
                about me. What I want is to have as much fun as possible with
                the people I love, so please, none of the following: Do not use
                any phrases that can be discriminatory toward sexual
                orientation, race, and/or disabilities. You do not know every
                person’s story and what they consider hurtful/offensive. Shoot
                the shit but don’t cross any lines. No fighting. While I doubt
                this will be an issue, I still want to clarify that I do not
                want any skirmishes within the group or externally. If you have
                a problem, mediate it or vent to someone you know there
                (including me).

                While I do want us to have fun and let loose, we all need to be
                responsible enough with our drinking and actions. I am not
                afraid to put you on a drinking ban if a night goes too wonky
                because of you, and I hope you will hold me to the same
                standard.

                Unfortunately, no one here came from families where we were
                spoon-fed hundred-dollar bills. Flights and hotels might be
                expensive. I appreciate you just making the trip. If you can’t
                make it, or if you can only come for a night or two, I will
                understand. I want to keep it relatively cheap once we get
                there. The only activities I have on the agenda are bowling and
                Dave and Busters and Axe Throwing. All are optional, but I would
                like it if you were at least there if you do not want to
                participate. Food/drinks will be split based on what you order
                and calculated at the end of the trip. I want you to make this
                trip but not empty the bank.
