                While I do not expect you to empty your bank account on it, I do

                we’re there.
                Ideally, we cook up something together and watch it cash at a
                bar. You can do as little as $1 per day on a bet.

                Ben’s defining life achievement was when he came back down 20 in the middle of the third quarter to beat my Cavs in NBA 2k17 (Kyrie missed 2 clutch free throws to seal the game). When not glazing the Celtics or making ill-advised dynasty football trades, Ben is competing with me in GamePigeon mini-games. Ben helped me the most when I struggled with my identity and wrestling and supported me through one of the most transformative periods of my life. Though Ben is the worst Dynasty manager I’ve ever seen play the game, He’ll have the chance to trade Lazard to 4 other players in our league Nashville Weekend.</p><p class="fact-intro"> Fun Facts About Ben:</p>

              Randy is the person I wanted to be growing up: Hard working and serious, yet never taking himself or life too seriously. If you know Randy, you know he is a one-of-a-kind person. His laid-back nature might be tested this weekend, though.</p><p class="fact-intro">Fun Facts About Randy:</p>

                  Mr. Anthony Bosco is not a groomsperson, but if you’ve seen him on a night out, he knows how to throw down. A man who is constantly on the dance floor vibing, I expect Bosco to be one of the highlights of the weekend.</p><p class="fact-intro">Fun Facts About Bosco:</p>

                Whether your mindset is “This is woke P.C. created by the libs”
                or “I need a safe space”, we can all agree that this weekend is
                about me. What I want is to have as much fun as possible with
                the people I love. While I doubt
                there will be any issues, I want to set expectations. Please, do not:</p>
                <p>Use
                any phrases that can be discriminatory toward sexual
                orientation, race, and/or disabilities. You do not know every
                person’s story and what they consider hurtful/offensive. Shoot
                the shit but don’t cross any lines.</p>
                
                <p>No fighting. I do not
                want any skirmishes within the group or externally. If you have
                a problem, mediate it or vent to someone you know there
                (including me).

                While I do want us to have fun and let loose, we all need to be
                responsible enough with our drinking and actions. </p><p>I am not
                afraid to put you on a drinking ban if a night goes too wonky
                because of you, and I hope you hold me to the same
                standard.

                Unfortunately, no one here came from families where we were
                spoon-fed hundred-dollar bills. Flights and hotels might be
                expensive. I appreciate you just making the trip.</p>
                
                <p>I want to keep it relatively cheap once we get
                there. The only activities I have on the agenda are bowling and
                Dave and Busters and Axe Throwing. All are optional, but I would
                like it if you were at least there if you do not want to
                participate. </p>
                
                
                <p>Food/drinks will be split based on what you order
                and calculated at the end of the trip. </p>
                
                <p>I understand if you can't make this trip, can only make it for part of the trip, and/or do not want to participate in all activities. Your presence would be enough for me. I want you to make this
                trip but not empty the bank.
